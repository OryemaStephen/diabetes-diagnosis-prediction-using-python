# Diabetes diagnosis prediction

Building a simple model to predict diabetes in patients.

## Introduction

This project is aimed at developing a simple logistic regression model to predict diabetes using Python libraries Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Scikit Learn. The objective is to diagnostically predict whether a patient has diabetes based on certain measurements. All patients are females.

## Methodology

The data was contained in a CSV file. Data was explored and cleaned using Pandas and visualized using Matplotlib and Seaborn while the model was built using Scikit Learn. The logistic regression model was built to predict the probability that a given input belongs to a particular category.
